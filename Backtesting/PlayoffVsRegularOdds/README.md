# PlayoffVsRegularOdds (Data Exploration)

## About
This program calculates whether there is a significant difference between the
odds offered on regular season and playoff games. It does so by calculating the
loss generated by always wagering on favourite/non-favourite/tie games in both
regimes. The program is very similar to the LongShotBias code.
