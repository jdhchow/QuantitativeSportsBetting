# PlayoffVsRegularOdds (Data Exploration)

## Purpose
This program calculates whether there is a significant difference between the
odds offered on regular season and playoff games.

## Method
It calculates the loss generated by always wagering on
favourite/non-favourite/tie games in both regimes. The program is very similar
to the LongShotBias code.

## Results/Status
Project is complete. Results are saved as ExpectedReturnPlot.png.
