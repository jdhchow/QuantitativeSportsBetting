# LongShotBias (Data Exploration)

## About
We are interested in understanding whether there is bias towards the favourite
or non-favourite teams in NHL odds. To study this, we calculate whether there is
a significant difference in the loss generated by wagering $1 on the
favourite/non-favourite/tie. If there is, it likely means that the true
probability of the favourite/non-favourite winning is not accurately by the odds
and, moreover, that this difference varies between the favourite/non-favourite.

We empirically see that there is no significant difference between the losses.
This indicates that the difference between the win probability and odds for the
favourite/non-favourite/tie are similar.
