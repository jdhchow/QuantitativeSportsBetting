# LongShotBias (Data Exploration)

## About
We are interested in understanding whether there is bias towards the favourite
or non-favourite teams in NHL odds. To study this, we calculate whether there is
a significant difference in the loss generated by wagering $1 on the
favourite/non-favourite/tie.
