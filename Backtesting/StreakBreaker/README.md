# StreakBreaker (Strategy)

## Purpose
Locates and bets against teams that have had a three game win-streak. The theory
is that people are more likely to bet on a team that is on a winning streak
due to the "hot-hand" fallacy. This would overvalue that team and undervalue
the opposing team.

## Method
N/A

## Results/Status
Appears to have positive expected return. Needs further evaluation before
implementing in production.
