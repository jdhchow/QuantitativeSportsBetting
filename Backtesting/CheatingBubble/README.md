## Purpose
Determines if a teams on the bubble cheat. Consider team A which requires
a win to advance to the playoffs playing an opponent has already (dis)qualified.
Is team A significantly more likely to win than their odds imply?

## Method
We calculate the win rate of teams on the bubble.

## Results/Status
There are an insufficient number of teams on the bubble to draw any meaningful
conclusions about the win rate. The code is incomplete. Strategy has been
abandoned.
