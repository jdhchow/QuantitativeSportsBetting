# Synthetic Control (Strategy)

## Purpose
NBA strategy for in-game betting. After a certain time has elapsed in the game,
the model applies synthetic control to predict the final score. We do not have
access to historical in-game odds, so the placing of wagers will combine
human judgement with the model's predictive accuracy.

## Method
N/A

## Results/Status
Backtesting in progress.
